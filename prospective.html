              <p align="left"> I will join the department of Computer Science at the University of Houston as a tenure-track assistant professor, and am seeking for several Ph. D. students to study under my advisory starting from Fall 2024 (only for those who have submitted the applications to UH CS) or Spring 2025.
              </p>
              <p align="left"> <b>About UH (University of Houston):</b> UH is a Carnegie R1 (highest research activity) institution and among the top doctoral research universities in the US, and has a strong department of Computer Science. According to CSRankings, in 2024 UH is ranked at top 100 in Computer Science and ranked 23 in High-performance Computing (my field). According to Shanghai Ranking, in 2023 UH is ranked at top 70 in US. Located at THE downtown Houston, the 4-th largest city in the US, students in UH can also live a convenient and enjoyable life.

              <p align="left"> <b>About me:</b> Jinyang Liu (<a href="CV.pdf">full CV</a>) acquires his Ph. D. degree in Computer Science from University of California, Riverside in the summer of 2024. Prior to that, he has got the Master's degree in Data Science from Peking University in 2019, and got the Bachelor's degress of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Peking University in 2016. During his Ph. D. study, Jinyang has worked on the topic of scientific data lossy compression and several other High-performance Computing and Scientific Computing topics. He has presented publications in various highly prestigious conferences and journals such as ACM SIGMOD, IEEE/ACM SC, ACM ICS, IEEE IPDPS, IEEE BigData, IEEE Cluster, IEEE TPDS, etc. He has received <I>the Dissertation Year Fellowship (DYP)</I> award from UCR and a <I>Best Paper Finalist</I> from ACM ICS 23'. He has also developed several different scientific data error-bounded lossy compressors, namely AE-SZ, <a href="https://github.com/szcompressor/QoZ">QoZ</a>, FAZ, and <a href="https://github.com/Meso272/cusz-I/tree/nightly">cuSZ-I</a>.
