              <p align="left"> I joined <a href="https://www.uh.edu/nsm/computer-science/">the department of Computer Science of the University of Houston</a> as a tenure-track assistant professor from Fall 2024, and am seeking for 1-3 PhD students to study under my advisory starting from Fall 2025. My research fields include scientific computing, data compression, and AI for science. I have solid connections with national labs such as Argonne National Lab, and students have a good chance to collaborate with scientists in the national labs in their research and do internships in the national labs during their PhD studies.

              <p align="left"> <b>About me:</b> Jinyang Liu (<a href="CV.pdf">full CV</a>) acquires his Ph. D. degree in Computer Science from University of California, Riverside in the summer of 2024. Prior to that, he has got the Master's degree in Data Science from Peking University in 2019, and got the Bachelor's degress of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Peking University in 2016. During his Ph. D. study, Jinyang has worked on the topic of scientific data lossy compression and several other High-performance Computing and Scientific Computing topics. He has presented publications in various highly prestigious conferences and journals such as ACM SIGMOD, IEEE/ACM SC, ACM ICS, IEEE IPDPS, IEEE BigData, IEEE Cluster, IEEE TPDS, etc. He has received <I>the Dissertation Year Fellowship (DYP)</I> award from UCR and a <I>Best Paper Finalist</I> from ACM ICS 23'. He has also developed several different scientific data error-bounded lossy compressors, namely AE-SZ, <a href="https://github.com/szcompressor/QoZ">QoZ</a>, FAZ, and <a href="https://github.com/Meso272/cusz-I/tree/nightly">cuSZ-I</a>.
